                "For us futures are not a destination or something to be strived for but a medium to aid <i>imaginative thought</i>—to speculate with. Not just about the future but about today as well (...). There are no solutions (…) or even answers, just <i>questions, thoughts, ideas, and possibilities</i>, all expressed through the language of design. They probe our beliefs and values, challenge our assumptions and encourage us to imagine how what we call nature could be different. (…)<i>Not a solution, not a “better” way, just another way."</i> <sup>  2  </sup>
